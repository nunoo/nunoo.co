              I've loved making things for as long as I can remember, and wrote
              my first program when I was 6 years old, just two weeks after my
              mom brought home the brand new Macintosh LC 550 that I taught
              myself to type on.
            </p>
            <p>
              The only thing I loved more than computers as a kid was space.
              When I was 8, I climbed the 40-foot oak tree at the back of our
              yard while wearing my older sister's motorcycle helmet, counted
              down from three, and jumped — hoping the tree was tall enough that
              with just a bit of momentum I'd be able to get to orbit.
            </p>
            <p>
              I spent the next few summers indoors working on a rocket design,
              while I recovered from the multiple surgeries it took to fix my
              badly broken legs. It took nine iterations, but when I was 15 I
              sent my dad's Blackberry into orbit and was able to transmit a
              photo back down to our family computer from space.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, I'm the founder of Planetaria, where we're working on
              civilian space suits and manned shuttle kits you can assemble at
              home so that the next generation of kids really <em>can</em> make
              it to orbit — from the comfort of their own backyards.

                  When I'm not coding or launching things into space, I have an insatiable wanderlust that takes me to some incredible places. Travel has always been my way of finding inspiration and new perspectives.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In Kyoto, I spent a morning at Fushimi Inari shrine, hiking up the mountain through thousands of vermillion torii gates. The early mist made the whole experience feel otherworldly, and I ended up coding a small meditation app that night, inspired by the tranquility I felt there.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During a trip to Reykjavik, I chased the Northern Lights with nothing but a rental car and a thermos of coffee. After three nights of cloudy skies, I finally witnessed the aurora dancing across the sky near Lake Thingvellir. The experience reminded me why I love building things that feel impossible at first.
